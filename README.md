## General info
I made this application for fun and to train my skills in Python functionalities. This game is fully playable in two languages - english and polish including specific polish chars. 
There are about 3000 english words and 1000 polish words to discover. Application reads chosen words list from .txt file and randomizes the word to guess. User needs to type char, that is in hidden word. If user chooses the wrong letter, he will lose one of his lives. The game ends when the user guesses all the letters or loses all lives.
